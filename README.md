# KubeFile

A Kubernetes learning project demonstrating microservices architecture, file sharing, and URL shortening capabilities.

## ⚠️ Educational Purpose Only

**This project is designed exclusively for learning Kubernetes concepts and should NOT be used for production or any real-world applications.** It's a demonstration project to explore microservices, containerization, and Kubernetes orchestration.

## 🎯 Project Overview

KubeFile is a distributed application that showcases:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Multiple services communicating via gRPC
- **File Sharing**: Chunked file upload/download with progress tracking
- **URL Shortening**: Simple URL shortener service
- **Storage Management**: Integration with MinIO for object storage
- **Real-time UI**: Modern web interface with progress indicators

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project consists of several microservices:

- **Gateway Service** (Port 8080): HTTP gateway and web interface
- **File Sharing Service** (Port 50052): Handles file operations and storage
- **URL Shortener Service** (Port 50051): Manages URL shortening
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **MinIO**: Object storage for files

## 🚀 Live Demo

The project is currently running at: **https://kubefile.maruqes.com:10513/app**

*Note: This is hosted on an isolated VM solely for demonstration purposes and to show the project functionality.*

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) - For local Kubernetes cluster
- [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) - For development workflow automation
- Go 1.24+ - For building services
- kubectl - For Kubernetes management

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd KubeFile
   ```

2. **Start Rancher Desktop**
   - Install and start Rancher Desktop
   - Enable Kubernetes support
   - Ensure kubectl is configured to use the local cluster

3. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your K8s context
   echo "K8_CONTEXT=rancher-desktop" > .env
   ```

4. **Start development with Tilt**
   ```bash
   tilt up
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Web Interface: http://localhost:8080
   - Tilt Dashboard: http://localhost:10350

### Development Features

- **Live Reload**: Code changes automatically trigger rebuilds
- **Fast Builds**: Optimized Docker builds with caching
- **Port Forwarding**: Direct access to all services
- **Log Streaming**: Real-time logs from all services

## 🌐 Production Deployment

The production environment runs on **k3s** (lightweight Kubernetes) on an isolated virtual machine. This setup demonstrates:

- Container orchestration in a real Kubernetes environment
- Service discovery and networking
- Persistent storage management
- Load balancing and scaling
